Hi there. Today I'm going to show you how to use the lollms playground to make, debug,  execute and document python code.
Let's go.
First, open the playground and look for the preset called  "Make full python code". 
Press the validation button to put the preset content into the main input text area.
Now you need to update the elements delimited by @< and >@. 
We set the project title, the author and a description of the project.
Here we will create a code that uses matplotlib to show a sine wave.
Now press the generate text button to start generating the text.
The AI generates a code that can be tested using the button execute. If there is a bug, just correct it and regenerate.
Now you can execute the code.
It works as expected.
Finally, we can document the code we have just made. Just use the documentation text in the preset and run the generation.
As you can see, the AI gave a good README.md file that I can use on my github page.
Be aware that the quality of the output depends on the model you are using. Make sure you use a good model for coding. You can checkout the models leaderboard on hugging face.
I hope you liked this.
