  This is the default Airoboros fine tuning format for chat mode with context obedient question answering
  By obedient, JonDurbin means the model was trained to ignore what it thinks it knows, and uses the context to answer the question. 
  This expects an input block + an instruction block.
  The input block has two parameters, first a key:value pairs, then a text input.
  The instructions block tells the AI what to do.
