  This is the default Airoboros fine tuning format for chat mode with input.
  There are two parameters:
  - The first is the input, which is the subject of your injstruction. For example, if the instruction is summerize this text, then the input is the text.
  - The second parameter is the instruction itself. For example, summerize this text.
